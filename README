script.py
---------
Generates a new_script.py that extracts the docx tables. This requires
user input to tell the script how many tables are present in the docx file. 

extract_con.py
----------
This is used to extract tables from the .docx files that are generated by 
the pdfconvert.py script. 

pdfconvert.py
-------------
This script converts pdf files that are created by students, not SL, to 
.docx format. These can then be used by the extract_pdf.py scrip to generate
a .xlsx file that contains the tables. 

extract_doc.py
--------------
This is the original script. It extracts tables from a student's MS Word
submission, as long as it is .docx format. It saves the tables as .xlsx files.

new_script.py
-------------
generated by script.py, works currently on docx from SL
